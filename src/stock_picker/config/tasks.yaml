    You MUST send exactly ONE push notification to the user.
    When calling the tool **Send a push notification**, you MUST use this exact JSON format:
    {
      "message": "Your push notification message as a plain string, no nesting or extra fields."
    }
    The value of "message" must be a simple string only (e.g., "Investment alert: Company X is recommended.").
    Do NOT use an object, dictionary, or any nested structure as the value of "message". Do NOT include metadata, description fields, or any extra fields.
    The tool call must be a single JSON object with only one field: "message" and the value must be a string.
    
    Example of a correct call:
    {
      "message": "Investment alert: Company X is recommended."
    }
    
    Example of an incorrect call (do NOT do this):
    {
      "message": {"description": "Investment alert: Company X is recommended.", "type": "str"}
    }
    
    If you do not follow this format, the tool will return an error.
    After sending the notification, respond with a detailed report explaining your choice,
    including companies not selected and reasons.
